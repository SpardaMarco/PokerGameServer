## Notes
This project was developed using Java SE 21.
The list of dependencies used are the following:
- [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/)
- [jBCrypt](https://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/)
- [JSON](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)
- [GSON](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html)
## Run Server

```bash
$ java Server <port> [-l] [-r]
```

- \<port\> must be a valid port, ex: 8000
- [-l] is optional and enables logging
- [-r] is optional and enables the server in ranked mode

## Run Client

```bash
$ java Client <host> <port>
```

- \<host\> must be a valid host, ex: localhost
- \<port\> must be a valid port, ex: 8000

## Database

The database is stored in the `database` folder inside the project `src` folder. We are using a SQLite database.

In order to reset and populate the database with the initial data, run the following command:

```bash
$ TODO DB
```

The database contains only one table, `users`, capable of storing the following fields:
- username (PK)
- password
- rank
- session_token
- session_expiration

For the purpose of this project, the database is pre-populated with the following users:

| username | password (on login) | rank   |
|----------|----------|--------|
| marco    | marco    | 1000   |
| tiago    | tiago    | 2000   |
| ramos    | ramos    | 1000   |
| joao     | joao     | 1500   |
| rita     | rita     | 500    |
| jorge    | jorge    | -10000 |
| afonso   | afonso   | 5000   |
| camilla  | camilla  | 5000   |
| baquero  | baquero  | 0      |
| alberto  | alberto  | 0      |
| veronica | veronica | 0      |

The passwords are stored using BCrypt hash with *salt*.

A new token is generated using BCrypt hash with *salt* and the username when the user authenticates, and it is stored in the database. This token is valid for 24 hours.

The token can be used to reconnect to the server without the need to authenticate again.

## Communication

The communication between the server and the client is done using a custom message protocol and channels
Most of the classes implemented for this purpose are inside `connection/protocol` directory.

The communication can be divided into two main parts:
- **Messages**
- **Channels**

### Messages

Messages are the objects that are sent between the server and the client. They contain 4 important fields:
- **State**: that represents the type of message (e.g. CONNECTION_END, AUTHENTICATION, MATCH_RECONNECT, etc.)
- **Status**: that represents the status of the message (REQUEST, OK, ERROR)
- **Body**: that contains a string associated with the message (e.g. *"User successfully logged in"*, etc.)
- **Data**: that contains the data associated with the message (e.g. username and password, etc.)

This messages are being sent using the JSON format. The GSON library is used for the serialization and deserialization of more complex objects.

### Channels

The channels are the classes that are responsible for the communication between the server and the client. They can are divided into two different types:
- **ClientChannel**: that is responsible for the communication between the client and the server
- **ServerChannel**: that is responsible for the communication between the server and the client

Most of the channels API is defined in the `Channel` interface.

The channel stores the Socket and the associated Input and Output streams, and creates a new layer of abstraction for the communication between both parts.

### Exceptions

During the communication many different types of errors can occur and for a multitude of reasons. In order to classify these errors many types of exceptions were defined in the `connection/protocol/exceptions` directory.

## Game

The game implemented is a simple version of "Poker Texas Hold'em". The game is played between 6 players, the server being the dealer.

The most of the game logic and model is implemented in the `game` directory.

The number of players is easily configurable by changing the value of the constant `NUM_PLAYERS` in the `game/common/PokerConstants.java` class.

For easier manipulation of the game by the server, the main class `Poker` represents the current game instance state.
